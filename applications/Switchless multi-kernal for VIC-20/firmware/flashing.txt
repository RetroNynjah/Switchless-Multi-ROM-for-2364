The fuses that needs to be burnt differs a bit depending on which microcontroller is being used.
I have used the below fuses for ATmega328P but the same should be ok with 328 too.

ATmega328/ATmega328P
====================
Lfuse FF
Hfuse DE
Efuse FD

And for ATmega48A I have used the following which I think should be ok for all 48/88/168 variants except the PB variants

ATmega48/88/168
================
Lfuse FF
Hfuse DD
Efuse FE

This works for ATmega48PB. Haven't tried other PB variants.
ATmega48PB (88PB/328PB too?)
============================
Lfuse E7
Hfuse DD
Efuse FE

Some examples for using AVRDUDE to upload firmware using a USBASP programmer, setting inital image kernal image to 0 (mini-kernal) and burning the fuses at the same time:

48/48A
======
avrdude.exe -C avrdude.conf -v -p atmega48 -c usbasp -U efuse:w:0xFE:m -U hfuse:w:0xDD:m -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m -U eeprom:w:0x00:m -U flash:w:VIC-20_1.0_48_48a.hex
