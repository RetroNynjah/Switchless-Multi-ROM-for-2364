# C64 Mini-Kernal

This is the assembly source code for the C64 Mini-Kernal.
The project was created in CBM prg Studio

You need to adjust the menu to fit your needs and compile the Mini-Kernal yourself unless you are going with the exact same Kernals I did.

## Disclaimer:  
I'm not an assembly programmer which you should be able to tell by looking at the source. If the code doesn't work for you feel free to fix it,
If anyone wants to have a go at improving and optimizing the code you are free to do so too.
