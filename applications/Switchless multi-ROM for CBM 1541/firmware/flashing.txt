The fuses that needs to be burnt differs a bit depending on which microcontroller is being used.
I have used the below fuses for ATmega328P but the same should be ok with 328 too.

ATmega328/ATmega328P
====================
Lfuse FF
Hfuse DE
Efuse FD

And for ATmega48A I have used the following which I think should be ok for all 48/88/168 variants:

ATmega48/88/168
================
Lfuse FF
Hfuse DD
Efuse FE


Some examples for using AVRDUDE to upload firmware using a USBASP programmer and burning the fuses at the same time:

328P
====
avrdude.exe -C avrdude.conf -v -p atmega328p -c usbasp -U efuse:w:0xFD:m -U hfuse:w:0xDE:m -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m -U flash:w:1541_romswitch_1.1_328_328p.hex

48/48A
======
avrdude.exe -C avrdude.conf -v -p atmega48 -c usbasp -U efuse:w:0xFE:m -U hfuse:w:0xDD:m -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m -U flash:w:1541_romswitch_1.1_48_48a.hex

48P/48PA
======
avrdude.exe -C avrdude.conf -v -p atmega48p -c usbasp -U efuse:w:0xFE:m -U hfuse:w:0xDD:m -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m -U flash:w:1541_romswitch_1.1_48p_48pa.hex

88/88A
======
avrdude.exe -C avrdude.conf -v -p atmega88 -c usbasp -U efuse:w:0xFE:m -U hfuse:w:0xDD:m -U lfuse:w:0xFF:m -U flash:w:1541_romswitch_1.1_88_88a.hex
